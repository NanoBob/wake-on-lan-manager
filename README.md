# wake-on-lan-manager
This project serves as a simple tool to send wake-on-lan packets to devices on your local network.

It contains the following functionality:
- List of registered devices (by mac address)
- Current state of the device (on/off)
- Send wake on lan packet

The tool only works on linux due to using linux tooling for sending the wake-on-lan packets.
